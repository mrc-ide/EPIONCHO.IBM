  A stochastic, individual-based model for onchocerciasis transmission
---

**EPIONCH0-IBM is a stochastic, individual-based model for onchocerciasis transmission. A mathematical description can be found at https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007557.**

# 1. System requirements

EPIONCHO IBM is written in R (1) which is freely available for installation on Windows, Mac OS and Linux platforms from https://www.r-project.org. It is also recommended to install R Studio https://www.rstudio.com which provides a helpful user interface for R. EPIONCHO-IBM has been tested on Mac OS and Windows, but should be compatible with Linux and run on any desktop or laptop machine.

# 2. Installation guide

The model package can be downloaded and installed directly from a GitHub repository (https://github.com/mrc-ide/EPIONCHO.IBM). The remotes (2) package must be installed to do this. Installation should take no more than a few seconds on most desktop or laptop machines.


```{r, eval=T, echo = FALSE, collapse= FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mrc-ide/EPIONCHO.IBM")
library(EPIONCHO.IBM)
```

# 3. Demo

## 3.1 Simulating an endemic equilibrium without MDA

As in the previous vignette, before simulating treatment, the model can be simulated to the endemic equilibrium. It is best to run the model to equilibrium (```run_equilibrium = TRUE```, ```give.treat = 0 ```), save the output and use this as the starting point for MDA. Note that running the model to the equilibrium can be slow, taking in excess of 5 minutes (depending on machine performance). To run the model to equilibrium without treating in the same run, use the following code:

```{r}
#length of simulation in years
timesteps = 30

#should treatment be given, when and how often
give.treat.in = 0
treat.strt = 1; treat.stp = 16
trt.int = 1

#annual biting rate, which determines infection prevalence (60% microfilarae prevalence)
ABR.in = 1082

output_equilibrium <- ep.equi.sim(time.its = timesteps,
                                  ABR = ABR.in,
                                  N.in = 440,
                                  treat.int = trt.int,
                                  treat.prob = 0.65,
                                  give.treat = give.treat.in,
                                  treat.start = treat.strt,
                                  treat.stop = treat.stp,
                                  pnc = 0.05,
                                  min.mont.age = 5,
                                  vector.control.strt = NA,
                                  gam.dis.in = 0.3,
                                  run_equilibrium = TRUE,
                                  equilibrium = NA,
                                  print_progress = TRUE)
```

To stop the printing of the time as the model runs, set ```print_progress = FALSE```. Currently, with ```print_progress = TRUE```, when the model run reaches each year in the simulation, the year and % progress will be printed. For full details of inputs used in the ```ep.equi.sim``` function for endemic equilibrium runs, please see the introductory vignette: [Installing and Running EPIONCHO-IBM](https://github.com/mrc-ide/EPIONCHO.IBM/blob/master/vignettes/Running_EPIONCHO_IBM.Rmd). 

The last element,```"all_equilibrium_outputs"``` is the element required to simulate MDA without having to run the model to the endemic equilibrium.
For a full description of the outputs from ```ep.equi.sim```, please see the introductory vignette: [Installing and Running EPIONCHO-IBM](https://github.com/mrc-ide/EPIONCHO.IBM/blob/master/vignettes/Running_EPIONCHO_IBM.Rmd). 

## 3.2 Simulating more complex interventions: variable coverage and frequency of mass drug administration with ivermectin

### 3.2.1 Variable MDA coverage

Assuming you have already run the model and saved the output as described in section 3.1, you can simulate 25 years of annual mass drug administration with ivermectin with different coverage values at each round by running:

```{r}
timesteps = 30
treat.strt = 1; treat.stp = 26 #if model run stops in year 26, the last round is at the beginning of year 25
gv.trt = 1
trt.int = 1

treat.prob.variable.in <- c(0.65, 0.75, 0.5, 0.85, 0.9, 0.85, 0.5, 0.65, 0.9, 0.8, 0.6, 0.7, 0.95, 0.9, 0.95, 0.6, 0.5,
                            0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 0.9, 0.9, 0.85, 0.85) # this is vector of variable coverages at each round

output_treat_annual <- ep.equi.sim(time.its = timesteps,
                                   ABR = ABR.in,
                                   N.in = 440,
                                   treat.timing = NA,
                                   treat.int = trt.int,
                                   treat.prob.variable = treat.prob.variable.in,
                                   give.treat = gv.trt,
                                   treat.start = treat.strt,
                                   treat.stop = treat.stp,
                                   pnc = 0.05,
                                   min.mont.age = 5,
                                   vector.control.strt = NA,
                                   gam.dis.in = 0.3,
                                   run_equilibrium = FALSE,
                                   equilibrium = output_equilibrium$all_equilibrium_outputs,
                                   print_progress = TRUE)
```
Variable coverage is specified with the ```treat.prob.variable``` input, and note that the ```treat.prob``` input is no longer specified, which previously gave a single coverage for all rounds.

If in the above model run ```print_progress = FALSE``` is called, but ```gv.trt = 1``` is also specified, only the duration of MDA will be printed (no progress updates). Currently, with ```print_progress = TRUE```, when the model run reaches each year in the simulation, the year and % progress will be printed as before.
Note that ```timesteps``` is the total number of years for which the model is run. ```treat.start``` and ```treat.stop``` are the years within this duration at which MDA is given.

To visualise the infection dynamics through time during annual MDA, use:

```{r}
years <- output_treat_annual$years

plot(years, output_treat_annual$mf_prev, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'microfilarial prevalence', ylim = c(0, 1))

abline(v = seq(1, 25), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)

plot(years, output_treat_annual$mf_intens, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'mean microfilarial intensity')

abline(v = seq(1, 25), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)

plot(years, output_treat_annual$ov16_seroprevalence_no_seroreversion, type = 'l', xlab = 'time (years)', ylab = 'seroprevalence w/ no (black) and w/ finite (red) seroreversion', ylim = c(0, 1))
lines(years, output_treat_annual$ov16_seroprevalence_finite_seroreversion, col="red")
abline(v = seq(1, 25), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)
```

### 3.2.2 Variable timing (or frequency) of MDA

Assuming you have run the model to the endemic equilibrium (as described in secton 3.1), temporal infection trends during MDA specified with varying frequency (or different lengths of gaps between rounds) can be specified for a 25 year MDA programme by:

```{r}
timesteps = 30
treat.strt = 1; treat.stp = 26 #if model run stops in year 30, the last round is at the beginning of year 25
gv.trt = 1
trt.int = 1

treat.timing.in <-  c(1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
                      22, 23, 24, 25)

output_treat_variable <- ep.equi.sim(time.its = timesteps,
                                   ABR = ABR.in,
                                   N.in = 440,
                                   treat.timing = treat.timing.in,
                                   treat.prob = 0.8,
                                   give.treat = gv.trt,
                                   treat.start = treat.strt,
                                   treat.stop = treat.stp,
                                   pnc = 0.05,
                                   min.mont.age = 5,
                                   vector.control.strt = NA,
                                   gam.dis.in = 0.3,
                                   run_equilibrium = FALSE,
                                   equilibrium = output_equilibrium$all_equilibrium_outputs,
                                   print_progress = TRUE)
```

Variable treatment timing over the course of the MDA programme is specified with the ```treat.timing.in``` input. Note that the ```treat.int``` input is no longer specified, which gave a fixed interval previously across all rounds. 

```{r}
years <- output_treat_variable$years

plot(years, output_treat_variable$mf_prev, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'microfilarial prevalence', ylim = c(0, 1))

abline(v = treat.timing.in, col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)

plot(years, output_treat_variable$mf_intens, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'mean microfilarial intensity')

abline(v = treat.timing.in, col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)

plot(years, output_treat_variable$ov16_seroprevalence_no_seroreversion, type = 'l', xlab = 'time (years)', ylab = 'seroprevalence w/ no (black) and w/ finite (red) seroreversion', ylim = c(0, 1))
lines(years, output_treat_variable$ov16_seroprevalence_finite_seroreversion, col="red")
abline(v = seq(1, 25), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)
```

### 3.2.3 Compliance

Assuming you have run the model to the endemic equilibrium (as described in secton 3.1), compliance to the treatment can be specified with a correlation parameter, and/or a static percentage of never treated individuals. To use ONLY a static percentage of never treated individuals (for example 1%), you can set ```pnc = 0.01```, and make sure that ```correlated_compliance = "NO"```. If you want to use ONLY correlated compliance, set ```pnc = 0```, make sure that ```correlated_compliance = "YES"```, and set ```comp.correlation = 0.3``` or any other value in the range (0, 1). To use both, set ```pnc``` to any value within (0, 1), make sure that ```correlated_compliance = "YES"```, and set ```comp.correlation``` to any value within (0, 1). Below is an example using a static never treated percentage of 1%, and a correlated compliance value of 0.3, for 25 years of MDA.

```{r}
timesteps = 30
treat.strt = 1; treat.stp = 26 #if model run stops in year 26, the last round is at the beginning of year 25
gv.trt = 1
trt.int = 1

output_treat_correlation <- ep.equi.sim(time.its = timesteps,
                                   ABR = ABR.in,
                                   N.in = 440,
                                   treat.timing = NA,
                                   treat.int = trt.int,
                                   treat.prob = 0.65,
                                   give.treat = gv.trt,
                                   treat.start = treat.strt,
                                   treat.stop = treat.stp,
                                   pnc = 0.01,
                                   min.mont.age = 5,
                                   vector.control.strt = NA,
                                   gam.dis.in = 0.3,
                                   run_equilibrium = FALSE,
                                   correlated_compliance = "YES",
                                   morbidity_module = "NO",
                                   comp.correlation = 0.3,
                                   equilibrium = output_equilibrium$all_equilibrium_outputs,
                                   print_progress = TRUE)
```

Below are plots looking at mf prevalence, intensity, and the percentage of people never treated over time.

```{r}
years <- output_treat_correlation$years

plot(years, output_treat_correlation$mf_prev, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'microfilarial prevalence', ylim = c(0, 1))

abline(v = treat.timing.in, col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)

plot(years, output_treat_correlation$mf_prev, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'microfilarial prevalence', ylim = c(0, 1))

abline(v = treat.timing.in, col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)

plot(years, output_treat_correlation$percent_never_treated, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'percent never treated', ylim = c(0, 1))

abline(v = treat.timing.in, col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)

plot(years, output_treat_correlation$ov16_seroprevalence_no_seroreversion, type = 'l', xlab = 'time (years)', ylab = 'seroprevalence w/ no (black) and w/ finite (red) seroreversion', ylim = c(0, 1))
lines(years, output_treat_correlation$ov16_seroprevalence_finite_seroreversion, col="red")
abline(v = seq(1, 25), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)
```

### 3.2.2 Moxidectin vs Ivermectin

Assuming you have run the model to the endemic equilibrium (as described in secton 3.1), the drug used for treatment can be specified with parameters in the model. To use just Ivermectin or just Moxidectin, you can set the ```treat_type``` parameter to either ```"IVM"``` or ```"MOX"``` respectively. Note that using Moxidectin will change your delta time automatically to half a day (1 / 366 / 2).

If you want to switch between the drugs, you should set the ```treat.switch``` input parameter to be a list/vector with the same size as rounds of MDA, with the items at each index being the drug you want to use. Below is an example with 20 years of IVM and 5 years of MOX over 25 total years of MDA.


```{r}
timesteps = 30
treat.strt = 1; treat.stp = 26 #if model run stops in year 26, the last round is at the beginning of year 25
gv.trt = 1
trt.int = 1

trt.switch.in = c(rep("IVM", 20), rep("MOX", 5))

output_treat_drugtype <- ep.equi.sim(time.its = timesteps,
                                   ABR = ABR.in,
                                   N.in = 440,
                                   treat.timing = NA,
                                   treat.int = trt.int,
                                   treat.prob = 0.65,
                                   give.treat = gv.trt,
                                   treat.start = treat.strt,
                                   treat.stop = treat.stp,
                                   pnc = 0.05,
                                   min.mont.age = 5,
                                   vector.control.strt = NA,
                                   gam.dis.in = 0.3,
                                   run_equilibrium = FALSE,
                                   morbidity_module = "NO",
                                   treat.switch = trt.switch.in,
                                   equilibrium = output_equilibrium$all_equilibrium_outputs,
                                   print_progress = TRUE)
```

The model output will tell you the years and timesteps at which treatment is given, along with the drug at the related treatment time.
Below are plots looking at mf prevalence, intensity with the above treatment parameters.


```{r}
# Since we are using mox, DT = 1/366/2
years <- output_treat_drugtype$years

plot(years, output_treat_drugtype$mf_prev, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'microfilarial prevalence', ylim = c(0, 1))
abline(v = seq(1, 20), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)
abline(v = seq(21, 25), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.3)

plot(years, output_treat_drugtype$mf_intens, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'mean microfilarial intensity')
abline(v = seq(1, 20), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)
abline(v = seq(21, 25), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.3)

plot(years, output_treat_drugtype$ov16_seroprevalence_no_seroreversion, type = 'l', xlab = 'time (years)', ylab = 'seroprevalence w/ no (black) and w/ finite (red) seroreversion', ylim = c(0, 1))
lines(years, output_treat_drugtype$ov16_seroprevalence_finite_seroreversion, col="red")
abline(v = seq(1, 20), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1)
abline(v = seq(21, 25), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.3)

```

## 3.3 Vector control

Vector control is modelled in EPIONCHO-IBM by a proportional reduction in the annual biting rate (ABR), for a set period of time, as follows: 

```{r}

timesteps = 30
treat.strt = 1; treat.stp = 26 #if model run stops in year 30, the last round is at the beginning of year 25
gv.trt = 0 # no treatment given
trt.int = 1

output_VC <- ep.equi.sim(time.its = timesteps,
                                   ABR = ABR.in,
                                   N.in = 440,
                                   treat.timing = NA, #
                                   treat.int = trt.int,
                                   treat.prob = 0.65,
                                   give.treat = gv.trt,
                                   treat.start = treat.strt,
                                   treat.stop = treat.stp,
                                   pnc = 0.05,
                                   min.mont.age = 5,
                                   vector.control.strt = 3,
                                   vector.control.duration = 14,
                                   vector.control.efficacy = 0.75,

The following inputs specify vector control parameters: ```vector.control.strt``` specifies when vector control begins (which year); ```vector.control.duration``` specifies for how long (in years); and ```vector.control.efficacy``` specifies the efficacy of vector control (the proportional reduction in ABR), currently set to a default of 0.75.

We can visualise the impact of vector control with the following:

```{r}
# first we look at when the reduction in ABR occurs:

years <- output_VC$years

plot(years, output_VC$ABR_recorded, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'ABR', ylim = c(0, 1100))

# now we look at the impact on mf prevalence and intensity: 

tme2 <- seq(1, 30*366-1)/366

plot(years, output_VC$mf_prev, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'microfilarial prevalence', ylim = c(0, 1))

abline(v = c(3, 17), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1) # lines specifying where VC period
mtext("Vector control period", side=3, line=0.5, at=9.5, col="darkgrey") # Rotated y axis label

plot(years, output_VC$mf_intens, type = 'l', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'mean microfilarial intensity')

abline(v = c(3, 17), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1) # lines specifying where VC period
mtext("Vector control period", side=3, line=0.5, at=9.5, col="darkgrey") # Rotated y axis label

plot(years, output_VC$ov16_seroprevalence_no_seroreversion, type = 'l', xlab = 'time (years)', ylab = 'seroprevalence w/ no (black) and w/ finite (red) seroreversion', ylim = c(0, 1))
lines(years, output_VC$ov16_seroprevalence_finite_seroreversion, col="red")
abline(v = c(3, 17), col = 'grey', lwd = 0.1) # lines specifying where VC period
mtext("Vector control period", side=3, line=0.5, at=9.5, col="darkgrey") # Rotated y axis label


```

Future work will involve modelling vector control in a more sophisticated manner and to capture secular trends in biting rates.
